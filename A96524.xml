            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I cannot paſs by Two or Three more Inſtances of a ſpecial Remark and Obſervation. When
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:153756:28"/> the Prophet <hi>Elijah,</hi> was preſerved from the bloody Intentions of <hi>Jezabel,</hi> and conſtrained to fly for his Life; he had Angels for his Purveyors, a <hi>Brook</hi> to quench his Thriſt, Ravens to bring him Fleſh, a Widdow Woman in a Famine, to make him Cakes: When by reaſon of <hi>Jezabels</hi> Perſecution, many Prophets were put to Death: <hi>God</hi> raiſed <hi>Obadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi> to be a Friend to thoſe that Surviv'd; he hid them by Fifty in a Cave, and fed them with Bread and Water. When <hi>Jeremy</hi> was caſt into a Dungeon, and his feet ſtuck faſt in the Mire, then <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedmelech</hi> the <hi>Ethiopian</hi> became the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets Advocate, and he ſpake a ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable and effectual Word, for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets inlargement.</p>
                     <p>And if there were any need, to light a Candle to the Sun; variety of Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples might be produced, diſcovering wonderful Providences, for the Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the People of God. To men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion a few inſtead of many. When that horrible deviliſh Maſſacre of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> was acted on <hi>Bartho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomew</hi> day, being the <hi>Sabbath</hi> day, and the Lord Admiral <hi>Gaſper Collinius</hi> was barbarouſly Butchered (notwithſtanding<note place="margin">See Mr. <hi>Clarks</hi> Marty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rology.</note> many fair flattering Words promiſed unto him) Thouſands of <hi>Proteſtants</hi> were
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:153756:29"/> Murthered, inſomuch that the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Channel in the Streets ran down with Blood; yet then ſome were miraculouſly Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. Dr. <hi>Peter De-Moulin</hi> that emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Light in the Church, was preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the Murtherers, being hid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Kneading Trough. <hi>Merlin</hi> was preſerved for a Week or more in a Hay-Mough, where an Hen came every day, and laid an Egg, by the Nouriſhment whereof, he was kept alive. Another for Shelter, hid himſelf in a Coal-Houſe, which being without a Door, was the more unlikely for a place of Security: But (as <hi>God</hi> ordered it for the beſt,) a Spider came thither, and wove a Web over the place where he entered in; ſo that, the Murtherers went away, ſaying, there could be none there. At the Siege of <hi>Rochel,</hi> there was a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Enemy Fighting without, and a ſharper Enemy Conflicting within, <hi>viz.</hi> a dreadful Famine. And the City was almoſt famiſht when the <hi>Lord</hi> wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully relieved them, by cauſing the Tyde to bring to the Shore, abundance of Shell-Fiſh, the like whereof, never came there before, nor ſince, by which means, many Thouſands were preſerved Alive.</p>
                     <p>To all theſe, let's each one in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:153756:29"/> take a Survey of particular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences and make a Catalogue of <hi>Gods</hi> gracious Acts of Providences, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge thus in particular. Such a time I knew <hi>A pinching Famine,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I was in great ſtraits and perplexities; and I knew not where to have Bread, to put into my Mouth; then <hi>God</hi> fed me, and kept me alive. Such a time, I was in great danger of <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;</hi> then <hi>God</hi> preſerved me from the violence of both. Such a time, I was beſet with Thieves and Robbers, then <hi>God</hi> delivered me. Such a time, I was Sick of a long and dangerous Diſeaſe, and was even at the brink of the Grave, ready to fall into it; yet then, the <hi>Lord</hi> raiſed me up, and added more days to my Life. Such a time, Enemies made long furrows on my Back, and bereft me of my Goods, and diſpoſſeſt me of my Freehold, and depriv'd me of my viſible Livelyhood; yet maugre all the malice and fury of the worſt of Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, <hi>God</hi> hath kept me alive amidſt theſe Sufferings, and made ſupplies, and dayly Proviſions for me. Thus then I argue, What <hi>God</hi> hath done, he can do. He is one and the ſame Omnipotent, and <hi>All-Sufficient Lord God.</hi> I'le there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hold the Concluſion unalterable,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:153756:30"/> 
                        <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>God</hi> is able to relieve me now, as formerly: His Hand is not ſhortned, that it cannot help, his Ear is not hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, that it cannot hear; What <hi>God</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth, his providences perform to the utmoſt. From all theſe inſtances, we have ſtrong ground, for conviction and confidence in the truth of our Aſſertion, <hi>That</hi> God <hi>is All-Sufficient.</hi> I appeal to the Experiences of believing and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Chriſtians, who when they were invironed with Troubles and Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and even almoſt at their Wits end, not knowing which way to wind out themſelves, being deſtitute, or altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fruſtrated of all outward viſible Relief; yet, then they have retir'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſhut themſelves in their Cloſets, and faln upon their Knees, and have been earneſt and importunate Solicitors, at the Throne of Grace, and ſo have received a gracious Anſwer of their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</p>
                     <p>There is a remarkable Story or two, wherewith I have been much affected, and I ſhould be glad to Affect others accordingly. There was a poor Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, in the Univerſity of <hi>Oxford,</hi> who was very Learned, and Well-deſerving; but for want of Means, was like to have been put by his Degree; the loſs where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:153756:30"/> would have been much prejudicial to his Preferment in that Colledge where he Lived: Being much perplexed, he repairs to his Study, and falls upon his Knees, praying and begging Help from Heaven; before he had done Praying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> one knockt at his Study-Door, and told him, that the <hi>Vice-Chancellor</hi> ſent to ſpeak with him: He went to him preſently, and he gave him a conſiderable Sum of Money, whereby his Wants were ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed. <note n="|" place="margin">Dr. <hi>Barnaby Potter,</hi> Provoſt of <hi>Queens Colledge,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward Biſhop of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lile.</hi>
                        </note> This Man, afterwards became the Head of that Colledge, and from thence, was prefer'd to greater Promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: This Story, he told to a perſon of good Credit, from whom I had it; And he ſpoke it in a way of Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, Communicating his Experience, for the Incouragement of others.

                        </note> this I'le add another Story, concerning an Eminent Learned Profeſſor of the ſame Univerſity, who would in an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and thankful way, frequently make mention of his low Condition, when he came to the Univerſity: Much I my ſelf have heard him ſpeak to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. And after he became Head of a Colledge, and <hi>Regius Profeſſor,</hi> he would keep in his Study, his skin Breeches, which he brought with him to the Univerſity, as a Remembrancer of his
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:153756:31"/> former Poverty. One Story more I'le<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Chadder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of <hi>Emanu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el-Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</hi>
                        </note> tell of a Learned, and Eminently Godly Doctor of the Univerſity of <hi>Cambridge:</hi> He was Converted to be a ſound <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant</hi> in the beginning of Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beths</hi> Days; which when his Father (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>Papiſt</hi>) heard thereof, he ſent him a Groat, and withal a Meſſage, that he ſhould never have any more from him, unleſs he would change his Religion. This Meſſage did not alter his Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but he followed his Studies, and <hi>God</hi> raiſed him Friends; inſomuch, though he lived, after his Father ſo threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him, above <hi>Eighty</hi> Years; yet he never wanted Supplies elſewhere, though he received not a Penny from his Father. He proved ſo Eminent for his Parts and Piety, that he was Choſen the firſt Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of <hi>Emanuel-Colledge.</hi> When that Preferment was firſt offered him, he made a modeſt refuſal, being Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to himſelf of his own unworthineſs (For the beſt Men think meanlieſt of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves). But the Founder had ſuch a great Eſteem of him, inſomuch as he told him, if he would be no Maſter,<note place="margin">Sir <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>may.</hi>
                        </note> he would be no Founder of that <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</hi> How wonderfully did the <hi>Lord</hi> Provide for this good Man! Hereunto, we may apply that of the <hi>Pſalmiſt,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:153756:31"/> Pſal. 27. 10. When my Father and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther forſake me, then the</hi> Lord <hi>will take me up.</hi> This gracious Man found this truth experimentally made good to him, in particular: It's further reported, that he kept that very Groat, which his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſent him, till his dying day. He lived long, even till above an <hi>Hundred</hi> Years Old, and ſo Dyed in a good Old Age; He Lived deſired, and Dyed Lamented.</p>
                     <p>What ſhall I ſay further for the il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtration of the Doctrine of my Text?

Doth not <hi>God</hi> take care for Sparrows and Ravens, and take notice how many Young Ones are in every Neſt? Doth not <hi>God</hi> provide for Worms, and the meaneſt creeping Creatures?

                        <hi>in</hi> Iſrael <hi>concerning this thing.</hi> Hope is like a Prop or Pillar, to ſupport, and ſtay a Building from falling; It's an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor caſt out in a Storm to ſtay the Ship. The Church quietly bore thoſe ſad Calamities incumbent on them, <hi>Lam. 3. 26. It is good that a Man ſhould both hope, and quietly wait for the Salvation of the</hi> Lord. <hi>ver. 29.

                        <p>1. For Chriſts Satisfaction, He is ſaid<note place="margin">1. Chriſt's Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Rom. 3. 25. Matt. 20. 28. 1 Tim. 2. 6. Heb. 13. 10, 12.</note> to be a <hi>Propitiation,</hi> a <hi>Ranſome,</hi> and the <hi>price of our Redemption.</hi> He is not only a Prieſt, but <hi>an<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Altar and a Sacrifice.</hi> The Burnt-offering, Treſpaſs-offering, Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offering, Scape-Goat, Dead Bird: all theſe mention'd in the Book of <hi>Leviticus,</hi> related to Chriſt, who alone made ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for the Sins of his People.</p>
                        <p>Now this ſatisfaction is made up of two kinds of Obedience, <hi>viz.</hi> Active and Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive.</p>
                        <p>1. For Chriſts Active Obedience. He<note place="margin">1. Chriſt's Active O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience.</note> fulfill'd to a Tittle, all that the Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired. Chriſt was made under the Law, and became obedient to the Law of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, he came not to deſtroy, but to fulfil it. The Law required exact and perfect Obedience. It will not abate a Tittle, but curſeth all the Tranſgreſſors
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:153756:146"/> of it. Now Chriſt by his Perfect Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, performed whatever the Law requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. No meer Man could ever keep the Covenant of Works; Chriſt alone who was God and Man, fulfilled the whole Law. Chriſt pleaſed the Father in every<note place="margin">Matt. 3. 17.</note> thing. He is the <hi>Beloved Son in whom he is well-pleaſed.</hi> This the Apoſtle fully clears, Rom. 8. 3. <hi>For what the Law could not do, in that it was weak through the Fleſh, God ſending his own Son in the likeneſs of ſinful Fleſh, and for Sin, condemned Sin in the Fleſh.</hi> And the Reaſon is added, <hi>v. 4. That the Righteouſneſs of the Law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the Fleſh, but after the Spirit.</hi> The meaning is not, that the Law was weak in it ſelf, but through our default: The Law pointed at our diſeaſe, but could not heal it. But Chriſt took Fleſh upon him, and he by Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf a Sacrifice expiated for Sin, and by his Death, was the Death of Sin: And thus the Law is fulfill'd, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires perfect Righteouſneſs and perfect Obedience; And only they have intereſt in this great Priviledge, who are not Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal but Spiritual, whoſe Walks are not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Law of their own Luſts, but after the Law of the Spirit of Life.

                           </note> Expoſitor writes appoſitely to this Senſe, <hi>the Righteouſneſs and Juſtification of the Law conſiſts in this, that by a through Conformity with the Law, we may be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Righteous and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nblameable before God.

The ſame ſo regenerates us, that we take delight in the Law of God: And the Reliques of Sin in the Fleſh, he doth by Degrees aboliſh, that ſo at length we may be acknowledged by the Law it ſelf, without Blot or Spot.</hi> Thus far that Judicious Author: And thus it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently appears, that Chriſt hath made ſatisfaction to Divine Juſtice, by his Active Obedience in fulfilling the Covenant of
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:153756:147"/> Works, and yielding perfect Obedience to the whole Law.</p>

Many are the degrees of Chriſts Humiliation, as by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Fleſh upon him, as it were Uniting a clod of Earth unto his Divine Nature, and by ſuffering Contempt, Ignominy, and Reproach in the World, by taking upon him Humane Infirmities, of Wearineſs, Thirſt, Hunger, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But the higheſt degree of Chriſt's Humiliation, (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto we purpoſe to ſpeak) was the Death of the Croſs, which was the Signal Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of Chriſt, as the Apoſtle expreſſeth it, Phil. 2. 8. <hi>He humbled himſelf and became obedient unto Death, even the</hi> Death of the Croſs. There's a Gradation in the Words: <hi>Chriſt humbled himſelf,</hi> that was much, and <hi>became obedient unto Death,</hi> that was more, but to become <hi>obedient, even to the Death of the Croſs,</hi> that was moſt of all, even beyond all degrees of Compariſon: For Chriſt to yield up himſelf to Crucifixion, was a kind of Humiliation more than Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perlative.</p>

In his Sorrows are our Comforts: In his Sufferings con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts our Salvation, and in his Croſs our Triumph.</p>

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:153756:166"/> relates to the glorious Light breaking forth, in the days of the Goſpel. And this was the end of Chriſt's coming, <hi>to give light to them that ſit in darkneſs,</hi> Luk. 1. 79. <hi>A light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people</hi> Iſrael, <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 32. Hence we obtain renewed Spirits, inlightned Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, a Spirit of diſcerning, to diſcern between things that differ. Theſe are the Fruits of Chriſt's prophetical Office. All things neceſſary for Salvation are taught in the Word of Chriſt, and by the Spirit of Chriſt. The Word is a Lamp, and the Spirit directs us in the uſe thereof. The Spirit worketh by the miniſtry of the Word. We have no warrant for inward teachings by a Light within us (as ſome ſtrangely fancy) Thus we may diſcern, whether that Light which is within them (as they ſay) be a true or falſe Light, for if it be true, it borrows its Light from the Lamp of the Sanctuary, even the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Word of God, and accordingly walks. Otherwiſe that inward pretended Light, which derives not its Light from God's Word, is an <hi>Ignis fatuus,</hi> and will lead the Followers into by-paths and dangerous Ways. Wherefore let's be exhorted to keep cloſe to the Word of God, which is the Goſpel of Reconciliation, and the Goſpel of our Salvation; and let us be
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:153756:166"/> earneſt Solicitors unto Chriſt the great Prophet, that he would aſſiſt us by his Spirit, to underſtand his Will, revealed in his Word.

                        <p>2. God upbraideth none. It oft times falls out amongſt Men, that if they do a Kindneſs, they upbraid them with it who are the Receivers. But it is not ſo with God, he doth not exprobrate nor hit us (as we ſay) in the Teeth, either with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Defects or former Failings. And if Men be conſtant Suitors to great Perſons, they will ſoon be weary of their Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.

In that Text two things are principally obſervable.</p>
                        <p>1. Chriſt's Incarnation, out of theſe Words, <hi>Thou Bethlehem (i. e.</hi>) out of thee ſhall Chriſt come; there Chriſt was born.

                        <p>1. That Chriſt might appoint Laws and Statutes, which ſhould direct his People, and bind their Conſciences to the Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the ſame. Chriſt alone is the Lord of our Conſciences; what he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands is of abſolute Authority, not to be diſputed, but obeyed. But as for the Popes Canons and other obtruded Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions againſt the Law of Chriſt, they are of no eſtimation; only the Law of Chriſt is authentick, and all other Laws muſt be in Subſerviency and Subordination to the Law of Chriſt. Wherefore the Pope hath preſumptuouſly invaded Chriſts Kingly Office, by pretending himſelf to be the Head of the Church, and Chriſts Vicar, and ſo making Laws to bind the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. But Chriſt is the only Head; he is called <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

By me Kings Reign and Princes decree Juſtice; By me Princes Rule, and Nobles, even all the Judges of the Earth.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. Chriſt is King to Rule and Govern,<note place="margin">2.

Chriſts Kingdom is Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al.</note> and Command Obedience, and keep his Subjects in Obedience to his Laws: But we muſt know that the Kingdom of Chriſt is a Spiritual and an Eternal Kingdom.</p>
                        <p>1. Chriſts Kingdom is Spiritual, he is King of his Church, and Rules and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns the Spirits of Men. It was a curious Queſtion of the Apoſtles, <hi>Acts 1. 6. Lord wilt thou at this time reſtore the Kingdom to</hi> Iſrael? They fancied a Temporal King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Earthly Preferments; but Chriſt checks their curioſity in asking, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake in fanſying outward Dignities and Honours to themſelves, by any Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Government of Chriſt. For Chriſt ſaid unto them, <hi>v. 7. It is not for you to know the times and the ſeaſons, which the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath put in his own Power.</hi> There are many that oppoſe Chriſts Kingly Office: The <hi>Jews</hi> ſay, Chriſt ſhall be an Earthly King, and bring them again into their old inheritance, the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle them there, and bleſs them with abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:153756:170"/> of Earthly Bleſſings. The <hi>Papiſt</hi> deny Chriſts Kingly Office, for they make the Pope Head and Supream Judge in matters of Spiritual Cognizance. And another ſort there are who ſay there ſhall be a Perſonal Reign, and Chriſt ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy all Monarchies, and live Gloriouſly on Earth with his Saints. But Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf plainly overthrows theſe Opinions by his own Words, <hi>John 18. 36. Jeſus anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, My Kingdom is not of this World; If my Kingdom were of this World, then would my Servants fight, that I ſhould not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to the</hi> Jews, <hi>but now is my Kingdom not from hence.</hi> Chriſt by his Kingly Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority appointed Church Government,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 28.</note> and appointed Church Officers and Church-Cenſures; And that dreadful Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Excommunication rightly given is an Ordinance of Chriſt. Chriſt hath left his Church deſtitute of nothing con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ducing to the Right Government there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
                        <p>2. Chriſts Kingdom is Eternal, and this<note place="margin">2. Chriſts Kingdom is eternal.</note> is a Kingdom of Glory. All other King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms ſhall have their Periods: But the Kingdom of Chriſt ſhall never have an end. The Kingdom of Chriſt is an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Kingdom, and <hi>his Dominion is from Generation to Generation;</hi> and this Kingdom<note place="margin">Dan. 4. 3. 2 Pet. 1. 11.</note> is called <hi>the Everlaſting Kingdom of our
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:153756:170"/> Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> By which Scriptures (not to name any farther Proof) it evidently appears that the Kingdom of Chriſt laſteth to all Eternity; when all Kings ſhall yield up their Scepters to Chriſt, and all earthly Monarchies ſhall fail (which I believe will not be till the day of Judgment) Chriſt ſhall Reign (though I cannot underſtand perſonally on Earth, yet) I believe eternally in the Heavens.</p>
                        <p>3. Chriſt is King to Protect, Defend<note place="margin">3. Chriſt is King to protect, defend and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve his Church.</note> and Preſerve his Church from the Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and Out-rage of Enemies both Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral and Spiritual. Chriſt hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his Preſence to his Church, Matth. 28. 20. <hi>Lo I am with you always even unto the end of the World.</hi> The perpetuity of Chriſts preſence is a preſervative from the fury of Enemies: Although Enemies may make Bulworks and raiſe Batteries a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Church, yet they ſhall not be able to prevail againſt her. Chriſt told <hi>Peter,</hi> Matth. 16. 18. <hi>Thou art</hi> Peter, <hi>and upon this Rock I will build my Church, and the Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt it. Papiſts</hi> hence claim an infallibility of <hi>Peters</hi> Chair, and that he was chief Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> (which none of them could ever prove to this very day, not ſo much as he was ever at <hi>Rome,</hi> much leſs
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:153756:171"/> chief Biſhop there.) But <hi>Ambroſe, Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome</hi> and others of the Learned Fathers, underſtand by the <hi>Rock,</hi> not <hi>Peter</hi>'s Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but the Profeſſion of <hi>Peter</hi>'s Faith; It's ſaid, <hi>Super hanc petram, non ſuper hunc Petrum,</hi> for Chriſt built his Church upon the Faith, and not upon the Perſon. Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Expoſitors as <hi>Lyra, Hugo de ſancto Victore, Ferus,</hi> all theſe, though of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Party, expound the Rock to be<note place="margin">Bp. <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>'s Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> L. 2.

Let the worſt of Enemies put forth their rage to the utmoſt, and in their Malice and Fury endeavour the Deſtruction of the Church; yet the Church ſhall prevail againſt them. The Church is under Perſecution, but like a Vine it thrives by bleeding. What's the reaſon, but becauſe God is the Protector and Defender of his Church, Chriſt is the King of it?

                        <p>Another Scripture (which is more clear) I ſhall mention out of Iſa. 28. 16.—<hi>Therefore thus ſaith the Lord God, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold I lay in</hi> Zion <hi>for a Foundation, a Stone, a tried Stone, a precious Corner Stone, a ſure Foundation.</hi> Theſe are rare excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of a Stone, and this Stone is laid in <hi>Zion, (i. e.</hi>) the Church of God.—Let's review all theſe excellencies of a Stone, and it will evidently appear that they all meet in Chriſt in an eminent manner.</p>
                        <p>1. This Stone is laid for a Foundation.<note place="margin">1. A Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation Stone.</note> A Foundation Stone muſt be ſtrong and firm, whereon the Superſtructure may depend, for if the Foundation fail, the Building either ſinks or falls down. Now Chriſt is the Foundation of our Faith. He hath founded and ſetled his Church, and if we rely and hold faſt on Chriſt, we cannot miſcarry. The Doctrine of the Goſpel is built on Chriſt. <hi>Other Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can no Man lay, than that that is laid which is Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 3. 11. The Foundation which will hold, is neither Gold nor Silver, Hay nor Stubble, no Merits, no deviſed Will-Worſhip, theſe are rotten Foundations, and will fail. But the Foundation which will hold, is that of the <hi>Apoſtles and Prophets, Jeſus Chriſt himſelf being the chief Corner Stone,</hi> Eph. 2. 20.</p>
                        <pb n="106" facs="tcp:153756:175"/>
                        <p>2. This Stone is a tryed Stone. Some<note place="margin">2. A Tried Stone.</note> Stones are tryed and they moulder and are unfit for a Building; but Chriſt is eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way tried, by Buffeting, Scourgings, Crucifixion, and by the higheſt Malice that Men or Devils could put forth againſt him. Many try their Armour before they venture into Battel, whether it be Shot-proof. Now Chriſt is Bullet proof (as we ſay) and Armour of Proof, the whole Quiver of God's Arrows were ſhot againſt him, and yet he endured it, and came off Conqueror.</p>
                        <p>3. This Stone is a precious Stone: So<note place="margin">3. A pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Stone.</note> Chriſt is precious in himſelf. He is the Pearl of Price, and Plant of Renown, the chiefeſt of ten thouſands. Chriſt is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious in the eſtimation of the Father, he is the beloved Son, <hi>the brightneſs of the Father's Glory, the expreſs Image of his</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Heb. 1. 3.</note> 
                           <hi>Perſon.</hi> And he is precious in the account of all true Believers; they know how to value him, they admire his Beauty, and are raviſhed with his Love. They have intereſt in the Blood of Chriſt, and this is more precious than Millions of Worlds. If the Soul be precious (as we all acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg) how much more muſt he be preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous who redeems the Soul? and Chriſt alone is the Redeemer of the Soul.</p>
                        <pb n="107" facs="tcp:153756:175"/>
                        <p>4. This Stone is a Corner Stone. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<note place="margin">4. A Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner Stone.</note> Stones are knit and cemented to the Corner Stone; ſo all true Believers are cemented in one Body and knit to Chriſt their Head: He is the Corner Stone, and the Head of the Corner. 'Tis true that the Builders rejected this Stone. The <hi>Jews</hi> reviled, perſecuted and crucified Chriſt; yet he is the Perſon of whom the Prophecy (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 118. 22.) was fulfilled. And ſo the Apoſtle expounds that Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in his Sermon, Acts 4. 11. <hi>This is the Stone which was ſet at nought of you Builders, which is become the Head of the Corner.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>5. This is a ſure Foundation Stone.<note place="margin">5. A ſure Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> Stones may and are oftentimes laid for a Foundation, but they are not firm and ſtable, and no ways able to ſupport the Building; but Chriſt is a ſure, firm and ſtrong Foundation. To build on this Foundation, there's Strength and Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
                        <p>I might further add, 6. That (which<note place="margin">6. A living Stone.</note> is beyond humane Sence) Chriſt is a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Stone: And yet it is evident from the Word of God, 1 Pet. 2. 4, 5. <hi>To whom coming as unto a living Stone, diſallowed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed of Men, but choſen of God, and precious.—Ye alſo as lively Stones are built up a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Houſe.</hi> Now Chriſt is a living
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:153756:176"/> Stone, and he communicates Life unto his Members, and by vertue of his Life, they live. The Dead were raiſed by the Voice of Chriſt, and <hi>thoſe that are dead in Treſpaſſes and Sins, are quickned by Chriſt,</hi> Eph. 2. 1. Dry Bones take Fleſh and Sinews, and become an Army, when the Spirit breaths Life into them; ſo the<note place="margin">Ezek. 37.</note> dead, ſleepy, drowſy, never ſo unlikely in the Eye of Man, may be quickned by the Life of. Chriſt. But this compariſon I need inlarge no farther.</p>

                        <p>In order we begin with the Purchaſe of Juſtification.</p>
                        <p>And herein we are to conſider that we are not to treat of any legal Juſtification by works, ſo no Man can be juſtified, for we
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:153756:180"/> have all ſinned: None but Chriſt (who was and is God and Man United in one Perſon) could keep the Covenant of works: but we are to treat only of Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Juſtification, which conſiſts in the imputation of Chriſts Righteouſneſs.</p>
                        <p>In handling of this Juſtification we are to conſider,</p>

The Metaphor of Juſtification is taken from a Judge, who abſolves the Priſoner at the Bar, when a Pardon is brought from the King: So though we are Condemned by the Law, at the Bar of Divine Juſtice, yet we are juſtified and acquitted by the imputation of Chriſts Righteouſneſs. We read in Scripture of being <hi>Juſtified before God,</hi> Rom. 2. 13. <hi>and of being made Righteous,</hi> Rom. 5. 19. and <hi>of imputing Righteouſneſs,</hi> Rom. 4. 3. and of being accounted Bleſſed, who have Righteouſneſs imputed, and <hi>Sins remitted,</hi> Rom. 4. 6, 7.</p>
                        <p>All theſe are Synonymous Expreſſions, and ſerve for the farther Explication of the Doctrine of Juſtification. From the <hi>Quid Nominis</hi> let's come to the <hi>Quid Rei,</hi>

For thoſe things which we prize moſt, we love moſt: But becauſe there are many pretences, and ſemblances of Love, where Love in reallity is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; we muſt bring the Love which
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:153756:208"/> ought to be in every Believer towards Chriſt, unto the Touchſtone and Tryal. Wherefore I ſhall fix upon five tryals of our Love to Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>1. Our Love muſt conſiſt in an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal,<note place="margin">1. Our Love muſt conſiſt in an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of Chriſt.</note> chearful, and cordial Obedience unto the Commands of Chriſt. Obedience to Chriſt's Commands, is an evident Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of our ſincere Love to Chriſt, John 14. 21. <hi>He that hath my Commandments, and keeps them, he it is that loveth me.</hi> And ver. 23. <hi>If any Man loves me, he will keep my Words.</hi> It's not the verbal Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Love to Chriſt, that will ſerve the turn, but a practical Conformity to the Commands of Chriſt, which will obtain acceptance. Pretences of Love are like the barren Fig-tree, which had Leaves without Fruits, or like the Apples of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> which ſeemed beautiful to the Eye, but as ſoon as they were touched, they diſſolved into Cinders and Aſhes. We muſt not be Chriſtians only in Name, but in Deed and in Truth: We muſt not only name the Name of Chriſt, but we muſt depart from Iniquity. And we muſt not only ſay that we love Chriſt, but we muſt expreſs our Love by our Obedience unto his Commandments. And we muſt not<note place="margin">Deus non vult cum exceptone coli, Le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

I am ſure God's Love to us is infinitely greater than our Love can be to him. However we muſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour after a ſincere, chearful, and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Love. God's Love to us is his Bounty and Beneficence, our Love to him muſt be a Love of Duty and Service. And though we can never equalize and match the Love of Chriſt to us. Yet we muſt endeavour by our Obedience to ſtudy to pleaſe him, and walk in the ways of his Word, and hereby we giue Teſtimony of our Love to Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>2. Our Love to Chriſt muſt be a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream<note place="margin">2. Our Love to Chriſt. muſt be a ſupream &amp; principal Love.</note> and principal Love. Inferiour and ſecondary ſorts of Love are due to Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, provided they be in ſubordination to the Love of Chriſt, and neither ſtand in competition with him, nor oppoſition to him. We may and ought to love our Relations, and love our Lives and Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-Comforts, always provided that the primacy of our Affections be given to Chriſt. Though things of this World be dear and near unto us, yet Chriſt muſt be eſteemed dearer and nearer than all. Chriſt muſt be preferred above all and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:153756:209"/> all. The Parents of our Bodies, the Children of our Fleſh, the Wives of our Boſom, the Blood in our Veins, the Heart in our Breaſt, even all the deareſt things in this World muſt be laid down and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone if they ſtand in compariſon and com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>petition with Jeſus Chriſt.

Chriſt therefore muſt have the chiefeſt Love, more than ſuperlative, even our Love to him muſt be beyond all degrees of compariſon.

It muſt not be ſhared with any Corrivals: Chriſt will not admit any Competitors or Corrivals with him. He will either have all our Love or none.

When the Sun ariſeth in its Brightneſs, the leſſer Stars appear not: upon the appearance of

<pb n="178" facs="tcp:153756:211"/> have his Love parted between him and Anti-chriſt, between him and Mammon, between him and a Luſt; Chriſt will not be ſo unequally yoaked: The Ark and Dagon, the <hi>Ephod</hi> and <hi>Teraphim</hi> cannot ſtand together. A Mungril Religion, partly for Popery, and partly for Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiſm, is abominable in the fight of God. When Men (as Water-men look one way and Row another) pretend in viſage and ſhew to be for the Intereſt of Chriſt, but in reallity drive Deſigns for Anti-chriſt: When Men (as <hi>Sanballat</hi> and <hi>Tobiah</hi> offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to build for the <hi>Jews,</hi> but intended to deſtroy them) pretend in publick to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate the true Religion, but in private undermine and ſeek the extirpation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: ſuch as theſe God will diſcover and their Sins will find them out, and they ſhall appear not only odious to God, but to Men alſo.

It was the great Sin of the <hi>Jews</hi> to make mixt Marriages, and to be unequally yoaked with Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens: Inſomuch as their Language be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed them not to be a genuine ſort of the <hi>Jews,</hi> not of the right breed of the <hi>Jews:</hi> For they ſpeak in the Language of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and in the Language of <hi>Aſhdod.</hi> So it's their Sin, and a far greater to join Chriſt with Harlots, I mean, to yoak Chriſt and Anti-chriſt (as far as in them lies) together.

Chriſt ought to be loved for Himſelf, for his Beauty, Goodneſs, and
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:153756:212"/> Excellency. There's enough in Chriſt to enamour a Soul, and raviſh it with De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, notwithſtanding all the hardſhips and ſufferings which come by Chriſt. For one Beam of Chriſt's reconciled counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and one glimpſe of his Love will ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perabundantly recompence the greateſt ſufferings for his ſake. Wherefore let us lay aſide altogether all oblique aims, and colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral Intereſts, and in the ſimplicity and ſingleneſs of our Hearts love Chriſt with the moſt ardent Affection. The <hi>Shecemites</hi> embraced Circumciſion upon a Politick Deſign, to compaſs in all the Cattel and Subſtance of the <hi>Iſraelites.</hi> The People<note place="margin">Gen. 34. 23.</note> followed Chriſt for the Loaves: And therefore the <hi>Gadarens</hi> petitioned for Chriſt's departute, becauſe they were ſo affected with the loſs of their Swine, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that they preferred their Swine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Jeſus. A Man mentioned in the Goſpel, pretended ſuch reſpect to Chriſt, as he offered to follow him whether ever he went: But Chriſt who knew his Heart, diſcovered, that he only aimed at his own accommodations for a dwelling place, as may appear by Chriſt's Anſwer, Mat. 8. 20. <hi>And Jeſus ſaith unto him, The Foxes have holes, and the Birds of the Air have Neſts, but the Son of Man hath not whereon to lay his Head.</hi>

                        <p>Love is that grand laſting Grace: It laſts unto Eternity. Faith and Hope carry us (as I may ſay) to Heaven Doors and there leave us, for when we enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Heaven our Faith is turn'd into Viſion, and our Hope is turn'd into Fruition; there we ſhall enjoy the bleſſed Preſence of the Holy Trinity: But Love abideth for ever. We ſhall always love God: Our Love is here begun on Earth and ſhall never be conſummated till we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of Eternal Glory. Wherefore then whilſt we live here in this World, let us not abate a jot of our Love, but dayly endeavour after Augmentations: Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding Hardſhips and Oppoſitions from the World, let our Love to Chriſt be like the Love of <hi>Jonathan</hi> that abode in its Strength. Love which holds out to the end, which paſſeth through good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and bad report; both through fair and foul Weather: that's the Love which
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:153756:214"/> will obtain Acceptance. Love will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer Difficulties, as <hi>Jacob</hi>'s did to <hi>Rachel,</hi> who thought many years but a few days becauſe he loved her. Love to Chriſt will make us willing to paſs through Fire and Water, and encounter Sons of <hi>Anach,</hi> and Beaſts of <hi>Epheſus.</hi> Love will cauſe a Chriſtian to be willing to bear and ſuffer any thing for Chriſt: Perſecutions, Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, and variety of Sufferings, try the Sincerity and Conſtancy of a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an's Love to Chriſt, There's a conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Power in the Love of Chriſt, which engageth all Chriſt's adopted Children to hold faſt their Profeſſion, to be faithful to Death, to account Chriſt All in all, and perſevere in their Faith, ſo that Difficulties are as Whet-ſtones to ſharpen a Believers Fortitude. And the Snuffers of Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion makes the Saints Candles burn brigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.

                           <hi>Scripture hath concluded all Men under Sin, that the promiſe by Faith of Jeſus Chriſt might be given to them that believe.</hi> Who then can lay any claim to this Covenant but the true Believer, God accepts the Faith of a Believer through Chtiſt's Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, inſtead of legal Obedience: Where fore we read of that <hi>Righteouſneſs which was of Faith,</hi> which is a Righteouſneſs im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted by Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, even a Righteouſneſs without us, which is our Juſtification. And here's the great privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of a Believer; That he is juſtified by the Righteouſneſs of another, and not by any Righteouſneſs of his own, but only by the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt by imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: By Chriſt's Merits; of Unrighteous we are made Righteous. For ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, 2 Cor. 5. 21. <hi>For he hath made him to be Sin for us, who knew no Sin, that we might be made the Righteouſneſs of God in him.</hi> So that hence it's evident that He was
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:153756:216"/> accounted a Sinner by Imputation, for he imputed our Sins unto himſelf, and we are accounted Righteous by Imputation, for he imputes his Righteouſneſs unto us. Here then appears Riches of Mercies, that Evanglical Righteouſneſs is accepted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of Legal Righteouſneſs. Chriſt's Wiſdom makes amends for our Folly: Chriſt's Obedience for our Diſobedience, and Chriſt's abſolute Perfection, for our manifold Imperfections.</p>
                        <p>Now the Believer only hath intereſt in the Covenant of Grace. Covenants eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially include Conditions. The Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is a free Covenant, a free Gift, and of free Grace. The Condition on our part is Faith, but the Condition as well as the Covenant are given of God. Take heed therefore O Chriſtian that thou Sacrifice not to thine own Net and Dragge: O do not truſt to thy own Strength and Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as if thou wert able to perform this Condition: For the beſt of Believers by rheir own Strength are no more able to believe, than to perform the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.

<pb n="189" facs="tcp:153756:216"/> upon a Believers Heart, but this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is powerfully wrought by the Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of God's Spirit.

And by vertue of this Union we paticipate of Juice and Nouriſhment from Chriſt, as the Branch doth from the Vine, and receive influence as a Member from the Head, and we receive Supportation and Strength, as the Building from the Foundation. Farther yet in the very Grave we ſhall yet remain united to Chriſt. For Chriſt will be with us in the Grave. Every Saint is a part of Chriſt's Body, and not one Member can be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, otherwiſe (which is impoſſible) Chriſt's Body would not be compleat. And theſe Bodies of ours, (if they be the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of true Believers) they ſhall be <hi>made like unto the glorions Body of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>

                        <p>This Union is the ground of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with Chriſt. There' a mutual Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Communion between Chriſt and his Members, for in Chriſt there's a fulneſs, <hi>and of his fulneſs we receive Grace for Grace.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Joh. 1. 19.</note> There's in Chriſt fulneſs of Wiſdom to Counſel us, and of Mercy to pardon us, of Righteouſneſs to juſtify us, and of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs to ſanctify us, and of Eternal Glory to make us happy to all Eternity. The Head takes care of all the Members. Chriſt the Head of his Church will not leave it deſtitute of Supplies and continual Influences from him, Now it's Faith that makes particular application of all the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of Chriſt. By Faith we draw ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue from Chriſt, and fetch Supplies from him. In hearing, by Faith we taſte the ſweetneſs of God's Word: In praying, by Faith we have a ſacred Communion with God, and receive a gracious anſwer of our Prayers; In receiving the Lord's Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, by Faith we feel Strength and Help for the ſubduing of our Corruptions. So then Faith is an Inſtrument that makes Chriſt and all his Benefits our own by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Application.</p>

The Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of Augmentations and finiſhings of our Faith all proceed from the Operations of the Spirit of God. Where this Spirit is, it opens the eyes of the Mind, that ſo we may underſtand the infinite value of Chriſt, and the abſolute neceſſity of Faith to make particular application of him unto our ſelves. Faith is a wiſe gift of God, and it makes Believers wiſe unto Salvation. Faith and knowledge are hand-faſted and may not be ſeparated.

                        <p>2. The Spirit of God as it opens the eyes, ſo it inclines the will to yield ready Obedience unto Chriſt.

                        </p>
                        <p>A third Demonſtration is, That <hi>Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi>

                        <p>1. By the Graces of the Spirit, and the reſemblances whereunto the Spirit is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared.</p>
                        <p>1. For the Graces of the Spirit or Fruits they are mentioned, Eph. 5. 9. <hi>Goodneſs, Righteouſneſs and Truth.</hi> And a large enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meration is ſet down, Eph. 5. 22, 23. <hi>Love, Joy, Peace, Long-Suffering, Gentleneſs, Faith, Meekneſs, Temeprance:</hi> Every Grace is the Fruit of the Spirit. Now Chriſt as Head Communicates Grace to all his Members, and they receive according to their Meaſure and Proportion. There's in Chriſt a fulneſs of Wiſdom to Counſel, of Mercy to Pardon, of Righteouſneſs to Juſtify, of Holineſs to Sanctifie.

                        <p>2. Lets conſider the Reſemblances whereunto the Spirit is compar'd.</p>
                        <p>There are certain Metaphors mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Scripture, whereby the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties and Influences of the Spirit of God are more evidenced, as for inſtance.<note place="margin">1. The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to a Fire.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>1. The Spirit is compared to a Fire.</p>
                        <p>1. As Fire enlightens and gives Light to a whole Room; ſo the Spirit of God inlightens the underſtanding.</p>
                        <p>2. Fire aſcends, ſo where the Spirit of God is, there the affections are raiſed from Earth to Heaven.</p>
                        <p>3. Fire is Conſumptive, it burns Stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſo doth the Spirit burn and conſume Corruptions.</p>
                        <p>4. Fire hath a penetrative vertue to creep into the pores of a combuſtible Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. So doth the Spirit penetrate the Windings and Diverticles of the Heart: The Spirit ſearcheth the Reins and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers the moſt hidden things.</p>
                        <p>5. Fire doth inflame and transform things into its own nature: It makes combuſtible matter like it ſelf: So the Spirit of God fills the Soul with a Divine
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:153756:234"/> Ardour. It's called the <hi>Spirit of burning,</hi> Iſa. 4. 4. where the Spirit of God comes it purgeth away the Droſs of Corruptions by the <hi>Spirit of Judgment and by the Spirit of Burning.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>2. The Spirit is compared unto Water.<note place="margin">2. The Spirit is compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. 1. Water hath a quenching Vertue.</note> In Water there's a quenching and purify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Property.</p>
                        <p>1. In Water there's a quenching Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Water quencheth Fire, at leaſt abates and cools the heat; ſo where God's Spirit comes, it ſometimes quencheth the heat of inordinate Paſſions, and ſometimes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates cools and moderates the heat of them; God's Spirit is a Spirit of Meekneſs. A Man's own Spirit is a boiſtrous Spirit, which upon any diſguſt is all in a Flame. But God's Spirit extinguiſheth the heat of Fury and Anger. When Chriſt bad the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Sea be ſtill, there was a great Calm: ſo when the Spirit of God comes into the Spirit of Man it becalms all the Affections, it ſets them in order and fixeth them upon the right Objects. Philoſophers write, <hi>De ſedandis affectibus,</hi> and yet they are meer Strangers to that Meekneſs which is one of the Beatitudes, Mat. 5. 5. <hi>Bleſſed are the meek for they ſhall inherit the Earth.</hi> That is Meekneſs in a Theological accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, which moderates Anger and keeps it within juſt bounds, when there are cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:153756:234"/> of provocation. To know when to be angry and when to be meek is a great Point of Wiſdom. To be zealous in the cauſe of God, and meek in a Man's own cauſe is well beſeeming a Chriſtian. Wherefore <hi>Luther</hi> ſpeaking of a right placed Anger or Zeal, ſaith, <hi>It's the beſt</hi>

                        <p>In Water there's a purifying and clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing<note place="margin">2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Water hath a cleanſing Vertue.</note> Property. Water caſts out Garbidg, and noiſom Carrion. And as Water cleanſeth bodily Filthyneſs: ſo the Spirit of Chriſt cleanſeth from filthyneſs of Fleſh and Spirit, (<hi>i. e.</hi>) both outward and inward defilements. Where the Spirit of God takes it's habitation, it ringeth and waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all clean: what's filthy and noiſom it throws out: For God's Spirit will not co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit with a Cage of unclean Birds, and noiſom Luſts. We read that <hi>Elias,</hi> Chriſt's
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:153756:235"/> Fore-runner, was like <hi>a Refiners fire, and like Fullars Soap.</hi> As the Refiner purgeth out<note place="margin">Mal. 3. 3.</note> Droſs, ſo doth the Spirit of Chriſt purge out Sin and Corruption: and as the Fullers Soap ſcours, waſheth, and cleanſeth the Cloth and makes it pure and white: ſo doth the Spirit of Chriſt purify and cleanſe the Soul. At Chriſt's transfiguration we read, Mark 3. 3. <hi>And his Rayment became ſhining, exceeding white as Snow: ſo as no Fuller on Earth can white them.</hi> From this compariſon it's intimated that although other Fullers can make Garments white and clean, yet no Fullers Soap can make the Cloth ſo white and clean, as the Blood of Chriſt can purify and cleanſe the Soul.<note place="margin">3. The Spirit is reſembled to Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note>
                        </p>
                        <p>A third compariſon of the Spirit, (whereunto it's reſembled) is Ointment. The Properties of Ointment are,</p>
                        <p>1. To ſupple and aſſwage Humors in the Body: ſo doth the Spirit of Chriſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwage and bring down all proud ſwelling thoughts. High Inclinations are caſt down by the Spirit of God. The hard Heart is molified and of inſenſible it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes ſenſible, and of ſeared it becomes tender and apprehenſive of Sin.</p>
                        <p>2. Ointment hath a penetrating Power to paſs through the Pores, and diffuſe it ſelf through every Pore of the ill affected part: So where there is the Unction of
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:153756:235"/> the Spirit it openeth the Eyes, ſubdues the Will, raiſeth the Affections, enlargeth the Heart. Hence ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 Joh. 2. 20. <hi>But ye have an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction from the Holy One, and ye know all things,</hi> i. e. <hi>All things needful for Salvation.</hi> And this Unction is an abiding Unction, ver. 27. <hi>But the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing, which ye have received of him, abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in you, and ye need not that any Man teach you, that is, they need not, that any ſhould teach them any new Opinion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                        <p>3. Ointment hath a refreſhing and comforting Vertue. Ointments as they make way for the emiſſion of all noxious Humors, ſo likewiſe for the free paſſage of all Vital Spirits, which do enliven, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh and comfort the Heart.

                        <p>One is love to the Brethren, 1 Joh. 4. 14. <hi>We know that we have paſſed from Death to Life becauſe we love the Brethren.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Another Character is the loving of Chriſts appearing. The Apoſtle ſpeaks not only in his own name but alſo in the name of all Saints. <hi>Henceforth there is</hi>

                        <p>A third Character is effectual calling: If we make our calling ſure, thence we may be aſſured of our election. 2 Pet. 1. 10. <hi>Wherefore the rather Brethren give dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to make your calling and Election ſure.</hi>

                        <p>But we muſt know.</p>

                        <p>2. Aſſurance admits Degrees, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it's more ſometimes leſs. The beſt are not always at a ſtand: Upon ſtrict In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition in their Hearts, they find cauſe

And to Prayer joyn Hearing, Reading, Meditating, and receiving of the Lords Supper: And when once thou haſt got it, be ſure thou be thankful and watchful. Take heed of the leaſt Sin. The leaſt crum of Leaven muſt be caſt out. A Servant being incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged by more wages hath more ſtrong Obligations on him to ſerve his Maſter with more diligence and Fidelity.
